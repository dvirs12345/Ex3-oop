In this project we implement a game where robots are placed on one of 23 different graphs and they need to collect as many points as they can by eating the various fruits that are placed on the graph by walking on them.
You can choose to play the game manually by moving the robots along the graph yourself OR you can sit back and let our algorithem play the game for you (And then show off that you have collected so many points).  
We tried to make the robots eat ,collectively, as many fruites as possible to maximize the score gotten from eating them.

We have updated the game and now the game is semi multiplayer. If you choose to play this mode you are going to step up to the task of beating as many levels as you can (There are 11 of them now [0-11]) on manual. You can also, like in the previous version of the game, use our algorithm to play the game for you and try to beat as many levels a we can.   

This is the score you will have to achieve(Grade) and you are going to need to beat it in (Moves) amount of moves:

# MyGameGUI

In this class we implement the basic game functions for the init of the game and running it menualy and automaticly.
running the game includes running a gui which uses StdDraw and jOptionMenu.

# Graph_Gui

This class contains functions for drawing a graph, robots and fruits.
It also contains functions for creating gui windows.
The drawings and gui wiondows are made with StdDraw and Jframe.

# KML_Logger

This class represents a kml file and has functions for creating and saving one.
With this class we create a kml file that you can then, open in google earth to see ALL the things that went down in your game! 
The robot movements and fruit eating. In google earth you can simulate a run just like the one in your game. 

A picture exaple of kml file shown in google earth:
