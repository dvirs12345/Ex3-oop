In this project we implement a game where robots are placed on one of 23 different graphs and they need to collect as many points as they can by eating the various fruits that are placed on the graph by walking on them.
You can choose to play the game manually by moving the robots along the graph yourself OR you can sit back and let our algorithem play the game for you (And then show off that you have collected so many points).  
We tried to make the robots eat ,collectively, as many fruites as possible to maximize the score gotten from eating them.

running the game includes running a gui which uses StdDraw and jOptionMenu.

# Graph_Gui

This class contains functions for drawing a graph, robots and fruits.
It also contains functions for creating gui windows.
The drawings and gui wiondows are made with StdDraw and Jframe.

# KML_Logger

This class represents a kml file and has functions for creating and saving one.
With this class we create a kml file that you can then, open in google earth to see ALL the things that went down in your game! 
The robot movements and fruit eating. In google earth you can simulate a run just like the one in your game.
